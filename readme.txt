Using PyTorch I am building a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to perform the movie prediction. Here I will train the RBM model with 1 million training data and which contains files which has movies, ratings and user data.

At the end of the prediction I will use Plotly to create an interactive visualization chart to display information.

Here I have used 2D matrix where users are allocated in rows and movies are allocated in the columns, significance of this matrix is that this will help us to identify the which movies are rated high and which movies are underrated according to each user and this will be efficient to train the RBM model.
